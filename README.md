## Module 4 Challenge

## Instructions

This challenge involves analyzing school performance data using the pandas library in Python. To see this code in action clone the respository. You can see the difference in the starting point of this assignment by looking at the [PyCitySchools_starter.ipynd](https://github.com/myhre062/pandas-challenge/blob/main/PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb) file. You can see the work I contributed in the [PyCitySchools_completed.ipynd] (https://github.com/myhre062/pandas-challenge/blob/main/PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_completed.ipynb) file. To interact with the code navigate to the spot where you cloned the project in your terminal. Once you are in the **pandas-challenge** folder run the command **jupyter notebook**. (The most recent version of jupyter notebook should be installed on your machine for the best performance.)

### Dependencies
- pandas
- pathlib

### Data Files
- schools_complete.csv
- students_complete.csv
- PyCitySchools_completed.ipynd
- PyCitySchools_starter.ipynd

### Summary

The provided analysis script [PyCitySchools_completed.ipynd] (https://github.com/myhre062/pandas-challenge/blob/main/PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_completed.ipynb) explores various aspects of school data, focusing on Charter vs. District schools, the impact of school size, grade levels, school spending, and more.

#### Key Findings:
1. **Charter vs. District Schools:**
   - Charter schools outperform District schools.
   - Significant differences in '% Passing Math,' '% Passing Reading,' and '% Overall Passing' between the two.
   - Charter schools consistently outperform District schools.

2. **School Size Impact:**
   - Smaller schools tend to perform better, with one exception noted.

3. **Grade Level Impact:**
   - Grade levels have consistent average scores across math and reading.

4. **School Spending Analysis:**
   - Spending more money per student doesn't guarantee higher scores.

5. **Top-Performing and Bottom-Performing Schools:**
   - Charter schools dominate the top-performing list, while District schools take the bottom half.

### Limitations and Considerations
While the analysis provides valuable insights, it's important to acknowledge its limitations. The data may present Charter schools in a positive light and District schools in a less positive light. To ensure a fair assessment, it's crucial to identify areas for improvement in District schools and explore ways to provide support.

By addressing specific challenges faced by District schools, such as school size, spending, and socioeconomic factors, we can work towards creating an educational environment that benefits all students.

Feel free to explore the analysis script for more details on the findings and methodologies used. Happy analyzing!
